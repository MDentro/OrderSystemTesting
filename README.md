## Introduction
This application is build for a one man business with the possibility to have a different user role for a representative
(with limited access) in case of absence of the owner. The owner can create, read, update and delete products. 
The products can get assigned a stock locations. The representative can only read the orders and process a payment. 
Orders can be made containing user data and different products. The owner and representative can sign in so endpoints 
can be protected. 
Furthermore, images supporting the products can be uploaded and more.


## Necessities
* Code editor to run the application. IntelliJ IDEA is used during development
* Git repository link: https://github.com/MDentro/OrderSystem
* Internet connection
* Postman is used to test the endpoints
* Four Postman collections with all the JSON details to test the endpoints
    - _OrderSystem Authentication and authorisation
    - _OrderSystem Order
    - _OrderSystem Product and image
    - _OrderSystem Stocklocation
* Java version 17
* Maven
* Database


## Installation Manual

### Installing the needed applications

* IntelliJ IDEA:
  The code editor used during production can be downloaded here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows

* Postman:
  The application which replaced the frontend can be downloaden here: https://identity.getpostman.com/signup

* Maven:
  Which is used as project management tool is already included in IntelliJ IDEA. When using another IDE you can download 
  it here: https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html

* Java 17:
  If you don't have Java 17 installed it can be installed through IntelliJ IDEA. Please find a screenshot of IntelliJ IDEA below.

* PostgreSQL as database with pgAdmin is used during development, but you can also use a different relational database .


### Installing the Order System application
* Step 1: Download or clone the application from Git: https://github.com/MDentro/OrderSystem 
* Step 2: After opening the project Maven will install the necessary dependencies. If this doesn't work automatically 
please go to the pom.xml file and press the "M" icon in the right corner of the page.
* Step 3: PostgreSQL is used as a database. If you use a different database please install the right dependency by adding 
it to the pom.xml and press the "M" icon to install, als insert the correct replacements for all the following steps 
concerning PostgreSQL.
* Step 4: In order to connect the application to PostgreSQL please go to the application properties (can be found in the 
resources' folder) and change the username and password to your own credentials.
```yaml
    spring.datasource.username=YourUserNameHere
    spring.datasource.password=YourPasswordHere
```
* Step 5: Create a database in PostgreSQL through pgAdmin with the name "OrderSystem".
* Step 6: The application will run on localhost port 8090. Change this in the application properties (can be found at the top in the 
"resources" folder) if necessary.
* Step 7: Run the application.


### Running tests
There are two options for running the tests. Running with coverage or without.
Please search for the "test" folder in the folder structure and open this. In IntelliJ IDEA it looks like this:

![running-tests](assets/RunningTests.JPG)

#### Running tests without coverage
Please press with your right mouse button on the folder marked with the number 1 and then press with your left mouse button on the number 2

#### Running tests with coverage
Please press with your right mouse button on the folder marked with the number 1 and then hover on 2a and then move your mouse to 2b and press with your left mouse button.

In IntelliJ IDEA it looks like this:\

### Test users
| User name | Password      | Role  |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| admin     | admin@Test1   | ADMIN |
| user      | user@Test1    | USER  |


### Roles
There are 3 roles in the application
- The "GUEST" user doesn't need a login. This user can only request the product data (all, by category and by id) with the image. 
This person can also send an order.
- The "USER" user needs a login. It is used by a representative in case of illness or holiday. This person can do 
the same things as a GUEST user and can also look at the orders and request a list with unpaid orders and process a payment.
- The "ADMIN" user needs a login and can do everything the USER can but can also create/update/delete products and stock 
locations and upload images.
